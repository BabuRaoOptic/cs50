Web Programming with Python and JavaScript



Hello There,

So Basically I Created A Small Website For Books Information Using HTML and CSS. I created a main file first with a good background of books and multiple
buttons for other pages of my website. I have created different sections in my website like for kids, categories,newly releases, most reviewed, contact and about us.
All are functional with their own different pages to switch upon, except for the about us button for which I used alert box for some pop message on the 
browser screen. The Kids section contains a table full of books for kids with some use of unordered and ordered lists in the page and also some photos on 
the sides. Then comes the categories section were I have used buttons with bootstrap 4 commands on the buttons to treat them with different button command 
for each categories. And also all the HTML pages that are linked to the main pages have buttons on their respective page to switch anytime on any page.
Then comes the newly releases were a table made full of books and a quote is also inserted in the page to give a more good feel. Then comes the most 
reviewed page were books names are mentioned with the reviewer name and there ratings in a single table. And in the contact us , a page were emails 
are provided to mail any queries.(the emails provided there are dummy mails, just used for demonstration purpose).
